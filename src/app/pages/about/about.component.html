  <h1 class="purple-primary">What is Co-Op Day Care?</h1>
  <h4 class="purple-accent">Co-Op Day Care lets you share child care duties with other parents in your area.</h4>
  <p>The typical group has 5 parents and 5 children. Each parent takes care of all of the children one working day per week.
     This allows parents to continue working (at least 4 days per week) without the costly day care expenses. Truly the
     best of both worlds! For a regular 40 hour per week job, many employers are allowing employees to work four 10 hour days
     per week, while their children are too young for pre-school or kindergarten.</p>
